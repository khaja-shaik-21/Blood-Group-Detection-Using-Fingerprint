# 🩸 Fingerprint-Based Blood Group Detection

A Django-based web application that detects a user's blood group from a fingerprint image using a deep learning model. This project leverages machine learning and image processing to provide a non-invasive method of identifying blood types.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload fingerprint images through a web interface
- Use of a trained deep learning model (`.h5`) for prediction
- Django-powered backend with model integration
- Responsive frontend using HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Secure file handling and model prediction pipeline
